of the things that sets scikit-learn apart from other machine learning libraries.\n","- Pipelines basically let us define a series of perprocessing steps together with fitting an estimator.\n","- Pipelines will automatically take care of pitfalls like estimating feature scaling parameters from the training set and applying those to scale new data (which we discussed earlier in the context of z-score standardization).\n","- Below is an visualization of how pipelines work.\n","\n","<img
